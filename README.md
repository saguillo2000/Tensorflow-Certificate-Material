# Tensorflow-Certificate-Material

For the Tensorflow exam here are my resumes. In order to have a good result I recommend to use the following resources:

- Laurence Moroney course of Practical Deep Learning with TensorFlow (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)
- Hands On Machine Learning from Aurelien GÃ©ron
- TensorFlow Tutorials (e.g. Time Series, my worst field: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series)

Also you can check my YT video explaining in Spanish how was my experience with this Certificate: https://youtu.be/HiJDvL7kFc0
